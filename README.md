Key Shortcut Formatter enhances the presentation of keyboard shortcuts with simple CSS and JavaScript

== Description ==

The plugin adds one js-file which searches through your blog and adds extra HTML markup to `.key-shortcut` elements. 

A stylesheet is added that applies styling to the extra HTML markup.

This results in `.key-shortcut` elements looking somewhat like keyboard buttons.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the key-shortcut-formatter directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enhance presentation of keyboard shortcuts like so: `<code class="key-shortcut">ctrl + a + A</code>`
